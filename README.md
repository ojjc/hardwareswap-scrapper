# hardwareswap-scrapper
before spez destroyed reddit and made every subreddit go on lockdown

a python script that would scrub through r/hardwareswap for any used products that have a good deal. you simply imput a keyword ("5800X3D") and run the code and it will periodically scrap the subreddit for any new posts with that keyword. 
if there is a match, an email would be sent to you. because the script reruns so quickly (every 5 minutes, but it's easily adjustable), there is a limit to how many it can send at once.

of course, it's not perfect and many things could be tweeked but i made it in like a couple hours and it did a decent job until r/hardwareswap moved to discord :(

you would need yagmail for this to work (it will never work again but posting it here because why not)
